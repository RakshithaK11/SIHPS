## Problem Title
E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility. Offers educational pop-ups on the harmful components of your e-waste and their effects on the environment and human health if not disposed correctly. There could be an option to input the model of your old device and earn credit points relative to the amount of precious metals recovered from the device if disposed correctly.

## Idea
The growing number of electronic devices has become a defining characteristic of modern society in the quickly changing digital landscape of today.
While there is no doubt that this technological advancement has made our lives better, it has also given rise to a critical issue called electronic waste, or
e-waste. There is an urgent need for responsible e-waste management as a result of the exponential growth of electronic devices, which has led to a surge
in discarded accessories, parts, and peripherals.
E-waste, which includes old or broken electronics, is hazardous to both the environment and people's health. E-waste improperly disposed of can cause
pollution, exposure to hazardous materials, and long-lasting ecological harm. The significance of this challenge increases as electronic devices become
more pervasive in our lives.
To combat the risks to the environment and public health posed by the E-Waste Facility Locator is a crucial new digital tool for managing e-waste. The
growing complexity of managing e-waste and the need for easily accessible, accurate information on recycling and disposal facilities are the focus of this
ground-breaking solution. It serves as a link between people and ethical e-waste management technique
